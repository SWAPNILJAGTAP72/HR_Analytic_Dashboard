# HR_Analytic_Dashboard
I apologize for the lengthy response earlier. Here are the key insights from the HR Analytics Dashboard in 5 concise bullet points:

• High attrition in younger workforce: The 26-35 age group shows the highest attrition (111 employees), indicating a need to focus on retaining younger talent.

• Job role-specific issues: Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists have the highest attrition numbers, suggesting role-specific challenges.

• Early career turnover: There's a spike in attrition for employees with 0-5 years at the company, pointing to potential onboarding or early career development issues.

• Education-based attrition: Employees with Medical and Life Sciences backgrounds show the highest attrition rates, indicating possible retention challenges for these specialists.

• Salary-related attrition: Lower salary slabs appear to have higher attrition rates, suggesting a need to review compensation structures, especially for lower-paid positions.
